					<h1>How to get involved!</h1>
					<p>
					Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
					I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
					She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
					In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
					Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
					Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
					Didn't make sense not to live for fun
					Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
					So much to do, so much to see
					So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
					You'll never know if you don't go
					You'll never shine if you don't glow
					Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
					Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
					And all that glitters is gold
					Only shooting stars break the mold
					It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
					You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
					But the meteor men beg to differ
					Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
					The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
					The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
					My world's on fire, how about yours?
					That's the way I like it and I never get bored
					Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
					Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
					All that glitters is gold
					Only shooting stars break the mold
